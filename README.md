# My Language Learning Project

**Important Note for Users:** Before you start using this application for your own learning, please navigate to the "data" folder and remove the `GUIwordpool.json` file. This will ensure that my demo words are not included in your vocabulary practice, and you can begin creating your personalized vocabulary list.

## A vocabulary practice program

This project aims to develop an application that allows users to practice the vocabulary of their desired language. It is designed for anyone interested in learning another language, be it beginner, intermediate, or advanced, and should meet just about any language-learner's needs. The goal is to prompt users to practice words they are less familiar with more often than those they have already mastered.

The reason I decided to work on this project is that, as a language-learner myself, I have been in search of a program that does exactly this. While there are many apps and programs that help language-learners improve their speaking abilities, I have yet to find one that focuses solely on repetition. What makes my application stand out from most is its emphasis on repeated practice, specifically tailored to comply to **“Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve.”**

*For those of you unfamiliar with Ebbinghaus' Forgetting Curve:* 
 - The Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve represents how memory retention decreases over time without active review.
 - It suggests that information is quickly forgotten, particularly just after learning, unless it is consciously reviewed.

# User Stories

### Initial Setup and Word Entry:

- As a user, I want to be able to input a minimum 20 starting words in my desired language, categorize each as an adjective, noun, adverb, etc., provide their translations, and rate my familiarity with them using a scale from copper to platinum, so I can start my personalized vocabulary practice.
 
### Ongoing Learning and Daily Practice:

- As a user, I want to be able to add between 0-3 new words in each session, categorize them by wordtype (adjective, noun, etc...), provide translations, and have them automatically placed in the copper pool, to continuously expand my vocabulary.

- As a user, I want to choose the number of words (between 18-30) to practice with each day, allowing me to control my daily learning volume.

- As a user, I want to see each word on the screen one by one during a practice session, with the ability to check translations if needed based on my recall accuracy, to actively engage with and reinforce my learning.

- At the end of each session, as a user, I want the option to view a table representation of all the words I had just practiced with, to track my progress and and verify if the program accurately knows how well I know each word.

- As a user, I want words that I struggle to recall to be demoted to a lower proficiency level, and words in the copper pool to be repeated for three sessions after implementing them, ensuring effective retention and gradual progress in my learning journey.
  
- As a user, I want to be able to see all the words in my vocabulary. "all the Xs that have already been added to Y are displayed".

### Saving Progress

- As a user, I want to be able to save my current unfinished session so that I can come back to it later and finish. (If I don't want to come back and finish ever I don't have to).

- As a user, I want to be able to load my previously uninished (saved) session so I can continue from where I left off, enabling me to continue practicing from the exact point where I stopped, starting with the next unpracticed word from where I left off.

- As a user, I expect the application to automatically save my progress and state continuously, allowing me to incrementally improve my language proficiency.
